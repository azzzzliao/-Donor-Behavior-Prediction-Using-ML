# Donation-Data-Analysis-and-Forecasting-Project

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting donation behavior for a non-profit organization. Using **Python** and **machine learning techniques**, we explore patterns in donor contributions and build predictive models to forecast whether donors will continue to donate.

## Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** â€“ Data processing
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Machine learning models
