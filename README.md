# Donor-Behavior-Prediction-Using-ML

This is the final project for the **Data Analysis and Machine Learning with Python** course (Spring 2024), instructed by **Prof. Cheng-Yuan Ho**. This project focuses on analyzing and predicting donation behavior for a non-profit organization. Using **Python** and **machine learning techniques**, we explore patterns in donor contributions and build predictive models to forecast whether donors will continue to donate.

## Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** â€“ Data processing
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Machine learning models
